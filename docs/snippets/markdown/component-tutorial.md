???+ warning "This page addresses **single components** of `hover`"
    For illustration, we are using code snippets to pick out specific widgets so that the documentation can explain what they do.

    -   Please be aware that you won't need to get the widgets by code in an actual use case.
    -   Typical usage deals with [recipes](../../tutorial/t1-active-learning) where the individual parts have been tied together.
