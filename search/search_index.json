Advanced: help wanted Some context: the code blocks here are embedded using Juniper . the environment is configured in the Binder repo . What we've tried: 1 Bokeh's extension with JupyterLab 1.1 cannot render the Bokeh plots remotely with show(handle) , with or without the extension 1.1.1 JavaScript console suggests that bokeh.main.js would fail to load. 2 JavaScript magic cell 2.1 such magic is functional in a custom notebook on the Jupyter server. 2.2 such magic is blocked by JupyterLab if ran on the documentation page. Tentative clues: 2.1 & 2.2 suggests that somehow JupyterLab behaves differently between Binder itself and Juniper. Juniper by default trusts the cells . making Javascript magic work on this documentation page would be a great step. from hover.recipes import simple_annotator from bokeh.io import show, output_notebook # 'handle' is a function that renders elements in bokeh documents handle = simple_annotator(dataset) output_notebook() show(handle, notebook_url='http://localhost:8888') Tips: annotation interface basics Video guide Text guide There should be a SupervisableDataset board on the left and an BokehDataAnnotator on the right, each with a few buttons. SupervisableDataset push : push Dataset updates to the bokeh plots. commit : add data entries selected in the Annotator to a specified subset. dedup : deduplicate across subsets by feature (last in gets kept). BokehDataAnnotator raw / train / dev / test : choose which subsets to display or hide. apply : apply the label input to the selected points in the raw subset only. export : save your data (all subsets) in a specified format. We've essentially put the data into neighborboods based on the vectorizer, but the quality (homogeneity of labels) of such neighborhoods can vary. hover over any data point to see its tooltip. take advantage of different selection tools to apply labels at appropriate scales. the search widget might turn out useful. note that it does not select points but highlights them. new Juniper({ repo: 'phurwicz/hover-binder', isolateCells: false, theme: 'monokai' })","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"pages/tutorial/t0-quickstart/#ingredient-1-3-some-data","text":"Suppose that we have a list of data entries, each in the form of a dictionary.

This architecture named VectorNet is the (default) basis of active learning in hover . Custom models It is possible to use a model other than VectorNet or its subclass. Simply implement the following methods with the same signatures as VectorNet : train save predict_proba from hover.core.neural import VectorNet from hover.utils.common_nn import LogisticRegression def vecnet_callback(dataset, vectorizer): \"\"\" Create a model with vectorizer-NN architecture. \"\"\" # model.pt will point to a PyTorch state dict (to be created) # which gets cumulatively updated when we train the model vecnet = VectorNet(vectorizer, LogisticRegression, \"model.pt\", dataset.classes) return vecnet vecnet = vecnet_callback(dataset, vectorizer) # predict_proba accepts individual strings or list # text -> vector -> class probabilities print(vecnet.predict_proba(text)) print(vecnet.predict_proba([text])) Note how the callback dynamically takes dataset.classes , which means the model architecture will adapt when we add classes during annotation.

Recap from the tutorials before the handle is a function which renders plot elements on a bokeh document . Option 1: Jupyter We are probably familiar with this now: from bokeh.io import show , output_notebook output_notebook () show ( handle ) # notebook_url='http://localhost:8888' Pros & Cons This inline Jupyter mode can integrate particularly well with your notebook workflow. For example, when your are (tentatively) done with annotation, the SupervisableDataset can be accessed directly in the notebook, rather than exported to a file and loaded back. The inline mode is highly recommended for local usage. However, with a remote Jupyter server, it has trouble loading JS libraries or accessing implicit bokeh server ports. Option 2: Command Line bokeh serve starts an explicit tornado server from the command line: bokeh serve my-app.py # my-app.py # handle = ... from bokeh.io import curdoc doc = curdoc () handle ( doc ) Pros & Cons This is the \"classic\" approach to run a bokeh server. Remote access is simple through parameters specified here . The bokeh plot tools are mobile-friendly too -- this means you can host a server, e.g. an http-enabled cloud virtual machine, and annotate from a tablet.
